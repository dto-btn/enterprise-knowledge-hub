### Wikipedia

Wikipedia database backups are compressed `XML` files (*sadface*) that can be obtained from [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html).

* [Goto the dump link](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html)
* Search for the wiki dumps you need `enwiki` and `frwiki` for instance and click on their links,
* Download the `-index.bz2` and the actual dump file (large). The index file has the byte mappings and Article name for where to start extracting the multipart Article from the archive.
